# Age-and-gender-detection
Step 1: Detect faces in the input video stream  Step2: Extract the face Region of Interest (ROI), and apply the age and gender detector algorithm to predict the age and gender of the person.  The predicted gender will be ‘Male’ or ‘Female’, and the predicted age can be one of the following ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100). We previously used Raspberry Pi for some complex image processing projects like facial landmark detection and Face recognition application.  Components Required for Age &amp; Gender Classification Raspberry Pi Pi Camera Module Here, we only need RPi 4 and Pi camera module with OpenCV installed on it. OpenCV is used here for digital image processing. The most common applications of Digital Image Processing are object detection, Face Recognition, and people counter.
